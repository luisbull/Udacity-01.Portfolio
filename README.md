## How project was built

After the knowledge acquired through the studied lessons and personal researches.  I started by reading, analysing the Rubric requirements ([link](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/45/view)) and using the mockup web design ([link](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf)) as a guide in order to decide the best way to approach to the project. As a result I built a very simple website project that complies to pass the project.
